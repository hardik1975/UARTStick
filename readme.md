## Overview

![IMG_6009](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4426eec0-49e4-4b4b-a8c7-a0a5a33d2cde)

Say hello to UART Stick — a micro-sized, Arduino-compatible USB to UART converter designed for makers, tinkerers, and embedded developers.

Unlike bulky boards, UART Stick is tiny, hassle-free, and packed with all the essential features you need to program your microcontrollers or read serial data — all while fitting directly into your USB port.



## Features

1. Compact Design – As small as a USB plug, perfect for on-the-go prototyping.
2. No Wires Needed – Built-in USB edge connector for direct plug-and-play.
3. CH340G Based – Reliable and widely supported USB-to-Serial IC.
4.  Open Source – Always will be. Hack it, mod it, or build your own.
5. Arduino-Compatible – Program boards via Arduino IDE effortlessly.
6. On-Board LEDs – Power, RX, and TX LEDs for easier debugging and status indication. 



## Specifications 

| Parameter        | Value                     |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| IC               | CH340G                    |
| USB Connector    | Edge-mounted USB-A        |
| Operating Voltage| 5V                        |
| Logic Level      | 3.3V or 5V                |
| Board Size       | e.g., 20mm x 10mm         |


## Getting Started

### What You’ll Need

1. Arduino IDE (or any serial monitor)
2. UART Stick
3. USB port
4. Jumper Wires

### Steps to Use

1. **Connect to Your Target Device**  
   Wire the UART Stick to your microcontroller or module as follows:

   | UART Stick Pin | Target Device     |
   |----------------|-------------------|
   | VCC            | 3.3V or 5V        |
   | RX             | TX                |
   | TX             | RX                |
   | GND            | GND               |

2. **Plug in the UART Stick**  
   Insert it directly into your computer’s USB port — no cables needed thanks to the edge USB connector.  

3. **Select the Correct COM Port**  
   Select correct COM port in Arduino IDE or your preferred serial tool.

4. **Start Communicating**

    - Upload code to your microcontroller
    - Or monitor serial data
    - Or send/receive commands



## 🔧 Use Cases

Here’s how UART Stick fits into your daily prototyping and debugging workflow:

1. **Flashing Firmware**  
  Upload code to microcontrollers like Arduino, ESP32, STM32, or ATmega-based boards with ease.

2. **Debugging Sensors & Modules**  
  View real-time data or debug sensor output via Serial Monitor.

3. **Reading BLE Data**  
  Communicate with BLE modules like HM-10 or HC-05/06 to send and receive wireless serial data.

4. **General UART Communication**  
  Interface with any device that speaks UART — from GPS modules to embedded Linux boards (like Raspberry Pi’s UART GPIOs).

5. **Serial Console Access**  
  Open terminal access to headless boards or dev kits, especially useful for bootloaders, Linux boards, or ESPs in flashing mode.

6. **Part of Your Embedded Toolbox**  
  A reliable companion for DIY projects, robotics, IoT devices, and lab debugging tasks.
